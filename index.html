            <h2 class="cursive palevioletred">About Orchid Flowers</h2>
            <p class="cursive">The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, 
            with <em>blooms</em> that are often colourful and fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family.
            <br>Along with the Asteraceae, they are one of the two largest families of flowering plants.</p>

            <h3 class="cursive">Species</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Moth orchid</li>
                <li>Vanda coerulea</li>
                <li>Waling-waling</li>
                <li>Vanda tricolor</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p class="cursive">Orchids have some unique features which help them in the evolutionary race. 
            <strong>They produce masses of pollen</strong> (which improves the chances of pollination), 
            very light seeds (which makes them easier to spread) and can grow on other 
            plants using them to support their own growth.</p>

            <h3>Countries with the most varieties of Orchids</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Colombia</li>
                <li>Ecuador</li>
                <li>New Guinea</li>
                <li>Brazil</li>
                <li>Peru</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="cursive">A total number of orchid species in South America is considerable. No one 
            probably knows for certain which country has the highest number since orchids 
            don't respect countries borders and all estimates depend on the extent to which 
            the rain forests in the area are explored by researchers. In  relatively small 
            by the area Ecuador occur almost 4,000 species. It may be at least as many 
            thereof in neighboring countries Columbia and Peru, but those aren't covered 
            as well as orchids in Ecuador.Either way, the orchid nursery Ecuagenera (Ecuador) 
            with over 6000 orchid varieties√Ç is known to be the largest orchid nursery in the region.</p>
